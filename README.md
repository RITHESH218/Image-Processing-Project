# Image Processing Project

A web-based image processing application that allows users to apply various filters and transformations to images directly in their browser. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides an intuitive interface for real-time image manipulation.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Easy drag-and-drop or file selection interface
- **Multiple Filters**: Apply various image filters including:
  - Grayscale
  - Sepia
  - Blur
  - Brightness adjustment
  - Contrast adjustment
  - Saturation control
  - And more...
- **Real-time Preview**: See changes instantly as you apply filters
- **Download Processed Images**: Save your edited images locally
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI/UX design

└── script.js           # Image processing logic and functionality
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and Canvas API for image manipulation
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Core image processing logic and DOM manipulation

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RITHESH218/Image-Processing-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Image-Processing-Project
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Use a local server (recommended for best performance)

4. Upload an image using the upload button or drag-and-drop

5. Apply filters and adjustments using the available controls

6. Download your processed image when satisfied with the results

## Demo

## How It Works

The application uses the HTML5 Canvas API to manipulate image pixels directly in the browser. When you upload an image:

1. The image is loaded onto a canvas element
2. Pixel data is extracted using `getImageData()`
3. Filters are applied by modifying pixel values
4. The processed image is rendered back to the canvas
5. Users can download the result using `toDataURL()`
